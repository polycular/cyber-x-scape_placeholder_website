> Website cyber-x-scape.at

## Development

### Setup

This website is static so it could be used by just opening the .html files within the folder web.

**Recommendation**

For convenience development we suggest to use a dev server with automatic browser reload capability on file changes.

We can recommend you the following Rust based tool:

- [devserver](https://github.com/kettle11/devserver)

Commands:

```sh
# Install devserver
cargo install devserver

# Start devserver
devserver --path web

# In case you are a Nix user you can simply run
nix-shell --pure
```
